  <p>Born in Canada, I've been living in the States since I was 9 aside from a brief stint in Japan.</p>
  <p>Career-wise, I've worked in analytics for the past 7 years but am looking for a change, so I've begun studying coding.</p>
  <p>Outside of work and study, I enjoy playing music, video games, and travel.</p>
